# Teleblocks
A visual editor for automating your Telegram account

## Background

Some time ago, I wrote about using the Telegram API (not to be confused with
the Telegram Bot API) to automatically reply to incoming messages in Telegram.
Every now and then, I get questions on the topic such as "How do I reply to
only specific users?" or "How do I automatically forward messages to another
chat?".

This project stub is a placeholder for a visual programming tool for users to
automate their Telegram account. For example, only replying to specific users
could be accomplished with the following:

Or muting a chat when a Quizarium game starts and unmuting it when the game ends:
